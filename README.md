Bucket List - Android
=====================

Pitch: We've all seen the "bucket list family" and some of us potentially grow green with envy about their mission and excitement for travel. While it may not be feasible for everyone to drop everything and travel the world full time, we all have dreams and aspirations of getting out and experiencing life to the best of our abilities. This is where Bucket List comes in. Bucket list is the app that allows you to draw out your dreams and aspirations for travel or accomplishment. When you check off an item on your list, you have the opportunity to add photos, journal entries and share the experience with friends and family.

MVP: As a user I want to log in to my bucket list so I can see the items on my list in a grid format. As a user I want to be able to create a bucket list item. As a user I want to be able to share my bucket list with other users (family members) so that they can add items to it as well. As I user I want to be able to click an item so that I can mark it as done, add photos, journal entries.

Stretch: Add a system into the user platform such that it would allow a user to create "family members" out of users linking users together in a social network. Add a system that allows users to share their done bucket list items on social media.
